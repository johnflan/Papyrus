The background paper is a literature survey in preparation for the work of the
project, due on the date given on the main page. The background paper
summarises essential material related to the subject of the project. There is
no minimum or maximum page length, but typically papers are between 10 and 20
pages long. The material in this paper can be incorporated into the project
final report.

The background paper must include a separate section on progress that
describes: the activities and accomplishments of the project to date; any
problems or obstacles that might have cropped up and how those problems or
obstacles are being dealt with; and plans for the next phases of the project.

Submission is via CATE in the usual manner (the exercise can be found in the
March period for your respective course). The report is not marked for credit.
Extensions will be granted only in the most exceptional circumstances.
